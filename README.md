# SymbiotaR2

Austin Koontz and William D. Pearse

## Overview

Designed to assist students, taxonomists, educators, and anyone
working with biological specimens, [Symbiota](https://symbiota.org/docs/)
is an open-source content management system built for the purpose of integrating 
virtual biodiversity databases. Over 766 natural history collections
have utilized Symbiota, and their usage has motivated the development
of Symbiota2, an updated version of the Symbiota platform. This package,
SymbiotaR2, allows users to access and download specimen- and 
observation-based data from a published Symbiota2 portal. 

More information about Symbiota2 can be found on the 
[website](https://symbiota.org/docs/symbiota2-project/). The GitHub page for 
Symbiota2 can be found [here](https://github.com/Symbiota2/Symbiota2);
if you want to set up a new Symbiota2 portal, please follow the instructions
on the relevant 
[documentation site](https://symbiota2.github.io/Symbiota2/setup/installation.html).
Finally, a review of the original Symbiota platform is offered in 
[Gries et al., 2014](https://bdj.pensoft.net/articles.php?id=1114).

## Workflow 

Below, we provide a general workflow for accessing Symbiota2 resources in
an R environment:

1. Determine the URL of the Symbiota2 portal you wish to access data from.
    - You will need to be approved access by the portal manager.
2. Install SymbiotaR2 (see [Installation](#inst) below).
3. Find the function corresponding to the resource you wish to pull from the 
Symbiota2 portal. 
    - Functions are named after the resources they download, 
  and are grouped according to the relevant API call.
    - Note that, because each Symbiota2 portal owner can load their 
  own plugins into the API, it's possible that not every API endpoint 
  will be covered.
4. Call the function, specifying the Symbiota2 portal using the `url` 
argument (see [Example](#ex) and [Portal Specification](#portspec) below).

## <a name="ex"></a>Example

The R code below provides an example of how to install a `Coordinates` 
resource from an example Symbiota2 portal

```{R}
library(SymbiotaR2)
myURL <- "http://imaginary-symbiota2-portal.com/api"
myCoordinates <- Coordinates(id = 6, url = myURL)
```

From here, the `myCoordinates` object can be used as desired.

## <a name="portspec"></a>Portal Specification

`SymbiotaR2_setup` will save to your `.Rprofile` a default instance 
(to use next time). Specifing a different `url` argument will let you
refer to a portal besides the default. The code below offers an example:

```{R}
SymbiotaR2_setup("http://imaginary-symbiota-portal.com/api", append=TRUE)

Coordinates() # Download from http://imaginary-symbiota-portal.com/api
Coordinates("http://another-imaginary-portal.com/api") # Download from a different portal
```

## <a name="inst"></a>Installation

This package is not currently up on CRAN (as it's being developed), 
but it can be downloaded by calling:

```{R}
library(devtools)
install_github("pearselab/SymbiotaR2")
```

Load the package using:

```{R}
library(SymbiotaR2)
```

## Testing

All of the package functions come with tests, for both pulling
a single SymbiotaR2 resource (using the `id` argument), or
a collection of resources (using `page`). Tests for each function 
are contained in the `tests/testthat` directory.

The `.yml` files contained in the `tests/fixtures` directory contain
`vcr` <em>cassettes</em>. `vcr` is a package SymbiotaR2 uses to accelerate
repeated HTTP requests. More information about the `vcr` package can be 
found on [the `vcr` page on GitHub](https://github.com/ropensci/vcr).

### Running the tests

To run the tests, specify the URL of the Symbiota2 portal you want to 
refer to in the assignment call at the beginning of the test script:

```{R}
url <- "http://imaginary-symbiota-portal.com/api"
```

Tests utilize the [`testthat` R package](https://github.com/r-lib/testthat),
and use the `expect_equal`, `expect_type`, and `expect_length` functions
to ensure that resources pulled from the Symbiota2 portal are correct. For
instance, a piece of testing code may look like:

```{R}
context("AccessStats")
vcr::use_cassette(name = "AccessStats_id", {
  data <- AccessStats(url = url, id = 4)
})
test_that("AccessStats_id", {
  expect_equal(length(data), 12)
  expect_type(data, "list")
})
```

The `data <- AccessStates(url = url, id = 4)` line is the Symbiota2 call, and the
`test_that` block below it contains the test conditions--here, that the `data`
object is a `list` of length 12. These test conditions will vary with the 
Symbiota2 portal used, so for tests to pass, the conditions
(and possibly the Symbiota2 calls, too) may need to be updated
for your particular Symbiota2 portal. 

## Contributions

Please check out our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/pearselab/SymbiotaR2/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you'd like to contribute to the tests in this package (e.g.
to include a test for a new plugin), remember that you'll need an
accessible SymbiotaR2 instance to determine test criteria.

As the underlying Symbiota2 API and the R package are still 
being worked on, we generally recommend holding off
on any package development until these are finalized.
If you're interested in contributing to the
package in the future, though, please [drop one of us an email and
we'll let you know when we're ready](http://pearselab.com/team.html)!
