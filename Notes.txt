+Taking care of Different.R functions
+Stats--dynamicProperties list item may warrant function restructuring...
+Numbers--page output strips away other components of return, only returning exsiccatiNumber...need to discuss
+RawLabels--ID parameter is a large, seemingly random numeric; may need to make this more clear to the user?
+CharacterStateImages--Is it appropriate for the page return of this to be a data.frame? The same question applies to many functions from the API...
+DescriptionDeletions--ID parameter is a large numeric value
+TagKey--ID argument is a string, corresponding to tagkey value
+SchemaVersion--data.frame may not be the most logical structure for page return. Should consider revising (again, potentially applies to a lot of functions)
+Lookupcounties--data.frame may not be the most logical structure for page return...
+Occurrences--a good example of a function that perhaps needs to be reformatted. Current lists are very, very long...
+Checklists--page return seems problematic...
