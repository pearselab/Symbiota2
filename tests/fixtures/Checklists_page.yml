        working (i.e., unreviewed and unpublished) checklist of the vascular plants
        growing outside of cultivation at The Morton Arboretum. It was assembled initially
        as part of an IMLS-funded Conservation Project Support grant to survey the
        Arboretum’s wooded natural areas, including the adjacent Hidden Lake Forest
        Preserve. During this project, the herbarium’s role was to voucher collections
        made as part of a sampling of the vegetation, and to ground-truth sampling
        plots. As part of this work, we surveyed the herbarium for all specimens collected
        on the grounds and have assembled from that survey a working checklist of
        the plants of the Arboretum for use by staff, volunteers, and anyone else
        who stumbles across it. The checklist by design excludes all planting growing
        in cultivation, whether accessioned or not, but is intended to include plants
        escaped from cultivation or persisting beyond the time of cultivation. Thus,
        for example, plants planted at Schulenberg Prairie and persisting to the current
        day are fair game and should be included in this checklist. Because the list
        was assembled from herbarium specimens, we expect that many species, even
        common ones, are not yet on the list. The checklist is organized in three
        major groups: the pteridophytes (ferns and fern allies), followed by monocots
        and dicots. Within each of those groups, species are organized alphabetically
        by family, then by genus and species. Nomenclature follows a combination of
        Flora of North America, USDA Plants, and the vPlants checklist (www.vplants.org).
        Localities and dates in this version of the checklist are all based on collections
        in our herbarium (MOR). In future versions of this checklist, descriptions
        may be expanded to include site records. If you find this useful and note
        any changes that need to be made (most likely additions), please let Andrew
        know (ahipp@mortonarb.org). I will update this as I have time.","authors":"Andrew
